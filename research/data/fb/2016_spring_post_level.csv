--- Featured Artist Spotlight #1: Adriel Luis ---

Adriel Luis, artist, musician, poet, and much more, will be debuting his project “Customs and Arrivals” at the 10th Annual NYCAASC! Adriel’s performance, an engaging fusion of visuals, music, spoken word, and DJing, recounts his own journey with checkpoints, as he explores the personal and social connections (and disconnections) between Asian Americans and global Asian communities.

Jes’s brilliant command of identity topics such as Asian America and queerness has made audiences throughout NYC rave with laughter, from Caroline’s on Broadway to the Gotham Comedy Club. NYCAASC has also had the pleasure of having Jes lead a workshop at last year’s conference about comedy as an innovative tool for radical activism. Provocative yet hysterical, their comedy is something you won’t want to miss!
