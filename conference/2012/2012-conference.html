        <h3>Critical Mass</h3>
        <p>2014 was not a landmark year in America’s long history of human rights violations, but it was significant in the refusal of bodies to stand back in the face of injustice. “BLACK LIVES MATTER!” was yelled into the night air, as the list of murdered names grew every day, connected by their perceived social identities of race, gender, sex, sexuality— ultimately, in difference: a difference marked on the body and fraught with meaning.</p>

                    <p>MAGNETIC NORTH hit the ground running in 2003 when emcees Direct and Theresa Vu came together to write a song for an Asian American rally in Berkeley, California. The piece, titled “We Will Not Be Moved”, was an ode to their heritage - a mix of refugee war stories and ruminations about skin color and stereotypes. Their mix of refreshingly honest rhymes and organic beats has since become the duo’s trademark as they went on to rock stages and move hearts at hundreds of venues across the nation. Direct, the mastermind behind their instrumentals, draws upon his classical roots to create beats heavy on melody and acoustic stylings. He tops off his production with insightful lyrics and a uniquely versatile flow that make his vocals as much an instrument as a message. And then there is T-Vu, a female emcee with no need for the “female” qualifier. A wordsmith of rare caliber and presence - she’s known for her precise delivery and no-nonsense rhymes.</p>
                    <p>TAIYO NA was honored in 2010 by Governor David A. Paterson and the State of New York for his “legacy of leadership to the Asian American community and the Empire State,“ Taiyo Na is a musician, writer, performer and educator. His critically acclaimed debut album Love is Growth (Issilah Productions, 2008) features the song “Lovely To Me (Immigrant Mother),” whose music video was heralded by MTV Iggy as “the realest thing seen in a while.” In 2010 & 2011, he released the albums Home:Word & Home:Word [Deluxe Edition] with hip-hop duo Magnetic North. The title track off those albums was released as a single in Japan in 2011 and hit #2 on their iTunes Hip-Hop charts, while the latter album reached #3. The albums included the music videos “Summertime,” “I Got My,” “Fukushima,” “New Love” and “Home:Word,“ which was directed by Wong Fu Productions. Their song “All On The Table” with Robert de Boron hit #1 on Japan iTunes hip-hop charts in April 2013. He was seen as “Min” in Dennis Kim’s play Tree City Legends directed by Marc Bamuthi Joseph at San Francisco’s Intersection for the Arts and the Painted Bride Arts Center in Philadelphia (2012 & 2014).</p>
